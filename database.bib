	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) is now commonly used in many domains because of its ability to provide a standardized, reproducible and controllable environment. In balance assessment, it can be used to control stimuli presented to patients and thus accurately evaluate their progression or compare them to different populations in standardized situations. In balance rehabilitation, VR allows the creation of new generation tools and at the same time the means to assess the efficiency of each parameter of these tools in order to optimize them. Moreover, with the development of low-cost devices, this rehabilitation can be continued at home, making access to these tools much easier, in addition to their entertaining and thus motivating properties. Nevertheless, and even more with low-cost systems, VR has limits that can alter the results of the studies that use it: the latency of the system (the delay cumulated on each step of the process from data acquisition on the patients to multimodal outputs); and distance perception, which tends to be underestimated in VR. After having described why VR is an essential tool for balance assessment and rehabilitation and illustrated this statement with a case study, this review discusses the previous works in the domain with regards to the technological limits of VR.},

Answer Recent studies explored using VR with pediatric patients undergoing procedures ranging from vaccinations and intravenous injections to laceration repair and dressing changes for burn wounds. Interacting with immersive VR might divert attention, leading to a slower response to incoming pain signals. Preliminary results have shown that VR is effective, either alone or in combination with standard care, in reducing the pain and anxiety patients experience compared with standard care or other distraction methods.},

	abstract = {Résumé
La réalité virtuelle apparaît comme une technologie prometteuse tant dans ses applications d’évaluation que de prise en charge thérapeutique en psychiatrie. Les outils de réalité virtuelle permettent de combiner divers atouts de par leurs interfaces : un aspect plus ludique de la tâche, un meilleur engagement du sujet, une forme de standardisation par l’immersion du sujet dans un environnement « contrôlé » et une dimension écologique qui mime des « fonctions de la vie quotidienne ». En psychiatrie de l’enfant et de l’adolescent, la réalité virtuelle a été jusqu’alors principalement utilisée dans des troubles anxieux caractéristiques (phobies spécifiques, phobie sociale et scolaire). Dans cette indication, tout comme dans les troubles des conduites alimentaires, des environnements spécifiques de réalité virtuelle sont utilisés comme outil de prise en charge par exposition aux situations anxiogènes. Dans les troubles du spectre de l’autisme, les applications thérapeutiques de la réalité virtuelle ont montré une efficacité dans la reconnaissance des émotions, l’amélioration des habilités cognitives et les compétences sociales. Concernant le trouble déficit de l’attention avec hyperactivité, la réalité virtuelle a été utilisée comme outil d’évaluation en situation scolaire de composantes telles que l’attention, l’hyperactivité et l’impulsivité. Si les premières études sont très encourageantes en termes d’évaluation, d’efficacité dans la prise en charge et d’acceptabilité des outils, de nouvelles études seront nécessaires pour renforcer la standardisation des méthodes et vérifier la généralisation et le transfert des bénéfices acquis aux situations réelles de la vie quotidienne.
Virtual reality is a relatively new technology that enables individuals to immerse themselves in a virtual world. It offers several advantages including a more realistic, lifelike environment that may allow subjects to “forget” they are being assessed, allow a better participation and an increased generalization of learning. Moreover, the virtual reality system can provide multimodal stimuli, such as visual and auditory stimuli, and can also be used to evaluate the patient's multimodal integration and to aid rehabilitation of cognitive abilities. The use of virtual reality to treat various psychiatric disorders in adults (phobic anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, addictions…) and its efficacy is supported by numerous studies. Similar research for children and adolescents is lagging behind. This may be particularly beneficial to children who often show great interest and considerable success on computer, console or videogame tasks. This article will expose the main studies that have used virtual reality with children and adolescents suffering from psychiatric disorders. The use of virtual reality to treat anxiety disorders in adults is gaining popularity and its efficacy is supported by various studies. Most of the studies attest to the significant efficacy of the virtual reality exposure therapy (or in virtuo exposure). In children, studies have covered arachnophobia social anxiety and school refusal phobia. Despite the limited number of studies, results are very encouraging for treatment in anxiety disorders. Several studies have reported the clinical use of virtual reality technology for children and adolescents with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive research has proven the efficiency of technologies as support tools for therapy. Researches are found to be focused on communication and on learning and social imitation skills. Virtual reality is also well accepted by subjects with ASD. The virtual environment offers the opportunity to administer controlled tasks such as the typical neuropsychological tools, but in an environment much more like a standard classroom. The virtual reality classroom offers several advantages compared to classical tools such as more realistic and lifelike environment but also records various measures in standardized conditions. Most of the studies using a virtual classroom have found that children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder make significantly fewer correct hits and more commission errors compared with controls. The virtual classroom has proven to be a good clinical tool for evaluation of attention in ADHD. For eating disorders, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program enhanced by a body image specific component using virtual reality techniques was shown to be more efficient than cognitive behavioural therapy alone. The body image-specific component using virtual reality techniques boots efficiency and accelerates the CBT change process for eating disorders. Virtual reality is a relatively new technology and its application in child and adolescent psychiatry is recent. However, this technique is still in its infancy and much work is needed including controlled trials before it can be introduced in routine clinical use. Virtual reality interventions should also investigate how newly acquired skills are transferred to the real world. At present virtual reality can be considered a useful tool in evaluation and treatment for child and adolescent disorders.},

To investigate the effectiveness of computerized virtual reality (VR) training of the hemiparetic hand of patients poststroke using a system that provides repetitive motor reeducation and skill reacquisition. Methods. Eight subjects in the chronic phase poststroke participated in a 3-week program using their hemiparetic hand in a series of interactive computer games for 13 days of training, weekend breaks, and pretests and posttests. Each subject trained for about 2 to 2.5 h per day. Outcome measures consisted of changes in the computerized measures of thumb and finger range of motion, thumb and finger velocity, fractionation (the ability to move fingers independently), thumb and finger strength, the Jebsen Test of Hand Function, and a Kinematic reach to grasp test. Results. Subjects as a group improved in fractionation of the fingers, thumb and finger range of motion, and thumb and finger speed, retaining those gains at the 1-week retention test. Transfer of these improvements was demonstrated through changes in the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and a decrease after the therapy in the overall time from hand peak velocity to the moment when an object was lifted from the table. Conclusions. It is difficult in current service delivery models to provide the intensity of practice that appears to be needed to effect neural reorganization and functional changes poststroke. Computerized exercise systems may be a way to maximize both the patients’ and the clinicians’ time. The data in this study add support to the proposal to explore novel technologies for incorporation into current practice.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Postural control associated with self-paced movement is critical for balance in frail older adults. The present work aimed to investigate the effects of a 2D virtual reality-based program on postural control associated with rapid arm movement in this population.
Methods
Participants in an upright standing position performed rapid arm-raising movements towards a target. Practice-related changes were assessed by pre- and post-test comparisons of hand kinematics and centre-of-pressure (CoP) displacement parameters measured in a training group and a control group. During these pre- and post-test sessions, patients have to reach towards yellow balls appearing on the screen, form a standardized upright position (with 15cm between the two malleoli). Training group patients took part in six sessions of virtual game. In this, patients were asked to reach their arm towards yellow balls appearing on the screen, from an upright position.
Results
After training, we observed improvements in arm movements and in the initial phase of CoP displacement, especially in the anticipatory postural adjustments. Learning curves for these two types of motor improvements showed different rates. These were continuous for the control of the arm movement, and discontinuous for the control of the CoP during the anticipatory postural adjustments.
Conclusion
These results suggest that some level of motor (re)-learning is maintained in frail patients with low functional reserves. They also suggest that re-learning of anticipatory postural control (i.e. motor prediction) is less robust than explicit motor learning involved for the arm reaching. This last point should encourage clinicians to extend the training course duration, even if reaching movement improvements seems acquired, in order to automate these anticipatory postural activities. However, other studies should be done to measure the retention of these two types of learning on a longer-term period.
Résumé
Introduction
Le contrôle postural associé à un déséquilibre auto-généré (intrinsèque) est essentiel dans la gestion de la fonction d’équilibration, notamment pour des patients âgés fragiles. Ce travail avait pour objectif d’étudier les effets d’un programme d’entraînement, basé sur un outil de réalité virtuelle en 2D, sur le contrôle postural associé à un mouvement rapide du membre supérieur au sein de cette population.
Méthodes
Les participants effectuaient des mouvements rapides du membre supérieur à partir de la position debout. Les changements liés à l’entraînement ont été évalués par des comparaisons pré- et post-test sur les paramètres cinématiques des déplacements de la main et du centre de pression (CdP), mesurés au sein d’un groupe témoin et d’un groupe entraîné. Pendant ces séances pré- et post-tests, les patients devaient pointer en direction de ballons jaunes qui apparaissaient sur l’écran, à partir d’une position debout standardisée (pieds placés avec 15cm d’écartement entre les deux malléoles). Les patients du groupe entraînement prenaient part à 6 séances d’entraînement par utilisation du jeu virtuel. Sur celui-ci, les patients devaient pointer en direction de ballons jaunes qui apparaissaient à l’écran, à partir de la position debout.
Résultats
Après l’entraînement, nous avons observé des améliorations du mouvement du membre supérieur et de la phase initiale du contrôle postural, notamment pendant la phase correspondant aux ajustements posturaux anticipés. Les courbes d’apprentissage, pour ces deux types d’optimisation motrice, étaient différentes. Celle observée pour le contrôle du mouvement du membre supérieur était continue pendant l’ensemble de l’entraînement, alors que celle observée pour le contrôle du centre de pression pendant les ajustements posturaux anticipés, révélatrice de l’optimisation de la prédiction motrice, était discontinue.
Conclusion
Ces résultats suggèrent qu’un certain niveau d’apprentissage (ou de réapprentissage) est maintenu chez des patients fragiles présentant de faibles ressources fonctionnelles. Ils suggèrent également que le réapprentissage du contrôle postural anticipé est moins robuste que l’apprentissage moteur explicite constaté pour le mouvement du membre supérieur. Ce dernier point devrait encourager les cliniciens à prolonger la durée de l’entraînement, même si des améliorations semblent acquises pour le mouvement du membre supérieur, afin d’automatiser les activités posturales anticipées. Néanmoins, d’autres études doivent être mises en place pour mesurer à plus long terme la rétention de ces différents apprentissages.},

	abstract = {Question: In people after stroke, does virtual reality based rehabilitation (VRBR) improve walking speed, balance and mobility more than the same duration of standard rehabilitation? In people after stroke, does adding extra VRBR to standard rehabilitation improve the effects on gait, balance and mobility? Design: Systematic review with meta-analysis of randomised trials. Participants: Adults with a clinical diagnosis of stroke. Intervention: Eligible trials had to include one these comparisons: VRBR replacing some or all of standard rehabilitation or VRBR used as extra rehabilitation time added to a standard rehabilitation regimen. Outcome measures: Walking speed, balance, mobility and adverse events. Results: In total, 15 trials involving 341 participants were included. When VRBR replaced some or all of the standard rehabilitation, there were statistically significant benefits in walking speed (MD 0.15 m/s, 95\% CI 0.10 to 0.19), balance (MD 2.1 points on the Berg Balance Scale, 95\% CI 1.8 to 2.5) and mobility (MD 2.3 seconds on the Timed Up and Go test, 95\% CI 1.2 to 3.4). When VRBR was added to standard rehabilitation, mobility showed a significant benefit (0.7 seconds on the Timed Up and Go test, 95\% CI 0.4 to 1.1), but insufficient evidence was found to comment about walking speed (one trial) and balance (high heterogeneity). Conclusion: Substituting some or all of a standard rehabilitation regimen with VRBR elicits greater benefits in walking speed, balance and mobility in people with stroke. Although the benefits are small, the extra cost of applying virtual reality to standard rehabilitation is also small, especially when spread over many patients in a clinic. Adding extra VRBR time to standard rehabilitation also has some benefits; further research is needed to determine if these benefits are clinically worthwhile.

The available rehabilitation programs for stroke patients are reviewed. Conventional rehabilitation strategies (Bobath, Brunnstrom, proprioception neuromuscular facilitation, motor relearning and function-based principles) are the mainstream tactics in clinical practices. Numerous advanced strategies for sensory-motor functional enhancement, including electrical stimulation, electromyographic biofeedback, constraint-induced movement therapy, robotics-aided systems, virtual reality, intermittent compression, partial body weight supported treadmill training and thermal stimulation, are being developed and incorporated into conventional rehabilitation programs. The concept of combining valuable rehabilitative procedures into “a training package”, based on the patient’s functional status during different recovery phases after stroke is proposed. Integrated sensorimotor rehabilitation programs with appropriate temporal arrangements might provide great functional benefits for stroke patients.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose
Hemiparesis resulting in functional limitation of an upper extremity is common among stroke survivors. Although existing evidence suggests that increasing intensity of stroke rehabilitation therapy results in better motor recovery, limited evidence is available on the efficacy of virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation.

Methods
In this pilot, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial with 2 parallel groups involving stroke patients within 2 months, we compared the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of virtual reality using the Nintendo Wii gaming system (VRWii) versus recreational therapy (playing cards, bingo, or “Jenga”) among those receiving standard rehabilitation to evaluate arm motor improvement. The primary feasibility outcome was the total time receiving the intervention. The primary safety outcome was the proportion of patients experiencing intervention-related adverse events during the study period. Efficacy, a secondary outcome measure, was evaluated with the Wolf Motor Function Test, Box and Block Test, and Stroke Impact Scale at 4 weeks after intervention.

Results
Overall, 22 of 110 (20\%) of screened patients were randomized. The mean age (range) was 61.3 (41 to 83) years. Two participants dropped out after a training session. The interventions were successfully delivered in 9 of 10 participants in the VRWii and 8 of 10 in the recreational therapy arm. The mean total session time was 388 minutes in the recreational therapy group compared with 364 minutes in the VRWii group (P=0.75). There were no serious adverse events in any group. Relative to the recreational therapy group, participants in the VRWii arm had a significant improvement in mean motor function of 7 seconds (Wolf Motor Function Test, 7.4 seconds; 95\% CI, −14.5, −0.2) after adjustment for age, baseline functional status (Wolf Motor Function Test), and stroke severity.

Conclusions
VRWii gaming technology represents a safe, feasible, and potentially effective alternative to facilitate rehabilitation therapy and promote motor recovery after stroke.},

	abstract = {Background
Physical inactivity and low resting heart rate variability (HRV) are associated with an increased cardiovascular deconditioning, risk of secondary stroke and mortality. Aerobic dance is a multidimensional physical activity and recent research supports its application as a valid alternative cardiovascular training. Furthermore, technological advances have facilitated the emergence of new approaches for exercise training holding promise, especially those methods that integrate rehabilitation with virtual gaming.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate cardiac autonomic modulation in individuals with chronic stroke post-training using a virtual reality – based aerobic dance training paradigm.

Methods
Eleven community-dwelling individuals with hemiparetic stroke [61.7( ± 4.3) years] received a virtual reality-based dance paradigm for 6 weeks using the commercially available Kinect dance video game “Just Dance 3.” The training was delivered in a high-intensity tapering method with the first two weeks consisting of 5 sessions/week, next two weeks of 3 sessions/week and last two weeks of 2 sessions/week, with a total of 20 sessions. Data obtained for HRV analysis pre- and post-intervention consists of HRV for ten minutes in (1) supine resting position; (2) quiet standing. High-frequency (HF) power measures as indicators of cardiac parasympathetic activity, low-frequency (LF) power of parasympathetic-sympathetic balance and LF/HF of sympatho-vagal balance were calculated. YMCA submaximal cycle Ergometer test was used to acquire VO2 max pre- and post-intervention. Changes in physical activity during dance training were assessed using Omran HJ-321 Tri-Axis Pedometer.

Results
After training, participants demonstrated a significant improvement in autonomic modulation in the supine position, indicating an improvement in LF=48.4 ( ± 20.1) to 40.3 ( ± 8.0), p=0.03; HF=51.5 ( ± 19) to 59.7 ( ± 8), p= 0.02 and LF/HF=1.6 ( ± 1.9) to 0.8 ( ± 0.26), p=0.05]. Post-training the participants had significantly higher VO2max. Number of steps during dance intervention significantly increased from the 1st to the 20th session (p{\textless}0.05).

Conclusion
The current study is the first to assess the effect of a virtual reality-based aerobic dance training paradigm on HRV among individuals with chronic stroke. Given that the paradigm used in this study improves cardiac autonomic control, future studies should incorporate dance as an adjuvant therapy into clinical treatment program and assess its long-term efficacy.},

	abstract = {Objective. To develop a systematic review of the literature, to describe the different virtual reality (VR) interventions and interactive videogames applied to the lower extremity (LE) of stroke patients, and to analyse the results according to the most frequently used outcome measures. Material and Methods. An electronic search of randomized trials between January 2004 and January 2014 in different databases (Medline, Cinahl, Web of Science, PEDro,  and Cochrane) was carried out. Several terms (virtual reality, feedback, stroke, hemiplegia, brain injury, cerebrovascular accident, lower limb, leg, and gait) were combined, and finally 11 articles were included according to the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results. The reviewed trials showed a high heterogeneity in terms of study design and assessment tools, which makes it difficult to compare and analyze the different types of interventions. However, most of them found a significant improvement on gait speed, balance and motor function, due to VR intervention. Conclusions. Although evidence is limited, it suggests that VR intervention (more than 10 sessions) in stroke patients may have a positive impact on balance, and gait recovery. Better results were obtained when a multimodal approach, combining VR and conventional physiotherapy, was used. Flexible software seems to adapt better to patients' requirements, allowing more specific and individual treatments.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—Approximately two thirds of stroke survivors continue to experience motor deficits of the arm resulting in diminished quality of life. Conventional rehabilitation provides modest and sometimes delayed effects. Virtual reality (VR) technology is a novel adjunctive therapy that could be applied in neurorehabilitation. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the added benefit of VR technology on arm motor recovery after stroke.Methods—We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane literature from 1966 to July 2010 with the terms “stroke,” “virtual reality,” and “upper arm/extremity.” We evaluated the effect of VR on motor function improvement after stroke.Results—From the 35 studies identified, 12 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria totaling 195 participants. Among them, there were 5 randomized clinical trials and 7 observational studies with a pre-/postintervention design. Interventions were delivered within 4 to 6 weeks in 9 of the studies and within 2 to 3 weeks in the remaining 3. Eleven of 12 studies showed a significant benefit toward VR for the selected outcomes. In the pooled analysis of all 5 randomized controlled trials, the effect of VR on motor impairment (Fugl-Meyer) was OR=4.89 (95\% CI, 1.31 to 18.3). No significant difference was observed for Box and Block Test or motor function. Among observational studies, there was a 14.7\% (95\% CI, 8.7\%–23.6\%) improvement in motor impairment and a 20.1\% (95\% CI, 11.0\%–33.8\%) improvement in motor function after VR.Conclusions—VR and video game applications are novel and potentially useful technologies that can be combined with conventional rehabilitation for upper arm improvement after stroke.},

Will they be motivated enough really to explore? Theory and research suggest that learners can and will, if the instructional systems are well-designed and if the learners are adequately prepared. In this paper, the components of learner control, self-regulated learning, and continuing motivation are examined as possible requirements and benefits of effective interactive instruction. A theoretical framework is advanced which illustrates the interdependence and mutual importance of these three components. Educational research in each of these three areas is analyzed, inconsistencies are discussed, and further support is developed for consideration of these components within an instructional situation. Finally, recommendations are offered for future research, to develop further what we know about what makes instruction effective and learners successful.},

The observed advantage of retrieval practice may be exaggerated because low motivation may result in deficient processing during (usually passive) rereading. Thus, when subjects are motivated to learn the material, the type of study strategy (whether retrieval practice or rereading) might be less important. To test this hypothesis, we conducted 3 experiments in which we manipulated the incentives (using monetary bonuses or time savings) for learning Swahili–English word pairs. Items that had undergone retrieval practice were better recalled than reread items on a final test 2 days later, but this effect did not interact with incentive level. These results provide some reassurance that lab findings from the testing effects literature likely generalize to real-world situations in which motivation to learn may be greater.},
