	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) is now commonly used in many domains because of its ability to provide a standardized, reproducible and controllable environment. In balance assessment, it can be used to control stimuli presented to patients and thus accurately evaluate their progression or compare them to different populations in standardized situations. In balance rehabilitation, VR allows the creation of new generation tools and at the same time the means to assess the efficiency of each parameter of these tools in order to optimize them. Moreover, with the development of low-cost devices, this rehabilitation can be continued at home, making access to these tools much easier, in addition to their entertaining and thus motivating properties. Nevertheless, and even more with low-cost systems, VR has limits that can alter the results of the studies that use it: the latency of the system (the delay cumulated on each step of the process from data acquisition on the patients to multimodal outputs); and distance perception, which tends to be underestimated in VR. After having described why VR is an essential tool for balance assessment and rehabilitation and illustrated this statement with a case study, this review discusses the previous works in the domain with regards to the technological limits of VR.},

Accessibility of VR today, more ludicWith the development of low-cost devices, this rehabilitation can be continued at home, easing the access to these tools, in addition to their ludic and thus motivating properties
What is the state of VR rehabilitation today ?Mainly used for phobia treating, for the moment2015 - In the medical field, VR has been used for the training of surgeons, especially for laparoscopic surgery, or for the treatment of phobias for example. The secure environment allows to control the stimuli presented to the patient so he can face his fear gradually.
 
Why use the VR ?Have complete control over environment and stimuli. So for tests, it is way more precise, as the beggining situation is the same. 
 
Limits:All the steps from the capture of information (motion, center of pressure, etc.) to the multisensory feedback (at least visual one) takes time and the delay can be perceived by the immersed patient and can modify his reactions},

Answer Recent studies explored using VR with pediatric patients undergoing procedures ranging from vaccinations and intravenous injections to laceration repair and dressing changes for burn wounds. Interacting with immersive VR might divert attention, leading to a slower response to incoming pain signals. Preliminary results have shown that VR is effective, either alone or in combination with standard care, in reducing the pain and anxiety patients experience compared with standard care or other distraction methods.},

	abstract = {Résumé
La réalité virtuelle apparaît comme une technologie prometteuse tant dans ses applications d’évaluation que de prise en charge thérapeutique en psychiatrie. Les outils de réalité virtuelle permettent de combiner divers atouts de par leurs interfaces : un aspect plus ludique de la tâche, un meilleur engagement du sujet, une forme de standardisation par l’immersion du sujet dans un environnement « contrôlé » et une dimension écologique qui mime des « fonctions de la vie quotidienne ». En psychiatrie de l’enfant et de l’adolescent, la réalité virtuelle a été jusqu’alors principalement utilisée dans des troubles anxieux caractéristiques (phobies spécifiques, phobie sociale et scolaire). Dans cette indication, tout comme dans les troubles des conduites alimentaires, des environnements spécifiques de réalité virtuelle sont utilisés comme outil de prise en charge par exposition aux situations anxiogènes. Dans les troubles du spectre de l’autisme, les applications thérapeutiques de la réalité virtuelle ont montré une efficacité dans la reconnaissance des émotions, l’amélioration des habilités cognitives et les compétences sociales. Concernant le trouble déficit de l’attention avec hyperactivité, la réalité virtuelle a été utilisée comme outil d’évaluation en situation scolaire de composantes telles que l’attention, l’hyperactivité et l’impulsivité. Si les premières études sont très encourageantes en termes d’évaluation, d’efficacité dans la prise en charge et d’acceptabilité des outils, de nouvelles études seront nécessaires pour renforcer la standardisation des méthodes et vérifier la généralisation et le transfert des bénéfices acquis aux situations réelles de la vie quotidienne.
Virtual reality is a relatively new technology that enables individuals to immerse themselves in a virtual world. It offers several advantages including a more realistic, lifelike environment that may allow subjects to “forget” they are being assessed, allow a better participation and an increased generalization of learning. Moreover, the virtual reality system can provide multimodal stimuli, such as visual and auditory stimuli, and can also be used to evaluate the patient's multimodal integration and to aid rehabilitation of cognitive abilities. The use of virtual reality to treat various psychiatric disorders in adults (phobic anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, addictions…) and its efficacy is supported by numerous studies. Similar research for children and adolescents is lagging behind. This may be particularly beneficial to children who often show great interest and considerable success on computer, console or videogame tasks. This article will expose the main studies that have used virtual reality with children and adolescents suffering from psychiatric disorders. The use of virtual reality to treat anxiety disorders in adults is gaining popularity and its efficacy is supported by various studies. Most of the studies attest to the significant efficacy of the virtual reality exposure therapy (or in virtuo exposure). In children, studies have covered arachnophobia social anxiety and school refusal phobia. Despite the limited number of studies, results are very encouraging for treatment in anxiety disorders. Several studies have reported the clinical use of virtual reality technology for children and adolescents with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive research has proven the efficiency of technologies as support tools for therapy. Researches are found to be focused on communication and on learning and social imitation skills. Virtual reality is also well accepted by subjects with ASD. The virtual environment offers the opportunity to administer controlled tasks such as the typical neuropsychological tools, but in an environment much more like a standard classroom. The virtual reality classroom offers several advantages compared to classical tools such as more realistic and lifelike environment but also records various measures in standardized conditions. Most of the studies using a virtual classroom have found that children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder make significantly fewer correct hits and more commission errors compared with controls. The virtual classroom has proven to be a good clinical tool for evaluation of attention in ADHD. For eating disorders, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program enhanced by a body image specific component using virtual reality techniques was shown to be more efficient than cognitive behavioural therapy alone. The body image-specific component using virtual reality techniques boots efficiency and accelerates the CBT change process for eating disorders. Virtual reality is a relatively new technology and its application in child and adolescent psychiatry is recent. However, this technique is still in its infancy and much work is needed including controlled trials before it can be introduced in routine clinical use. Virtual reality interventions should also investigate how newly acquired skills are transferred to the real world. At present virtual reality can be considered a useful tool in evaluation and treatment for child and adolescent disorders.},

	abstract = {Objective. To investigate the effectiveness of computerized virtual reality (VR) training of the hemiparetic hand of patients poststroke using a system that provides repetitive motor reeducation and skill reacquisition. Methods. Eight subjects in the chronic phase poststroke participated in a 3-week program using their hemiparetic hand in a series of interactive computer games for 13 days of training, weekend breaks, and pretests and posttests. Each subject trained for about 2 to 2.5 h per day. Outcome measures consisted of changes in the computerized measures of thumb and finger range of motion, thumb and finger velocity, fractionation (the ability to move fingers independently), thumb and finger strength, the Jebsen Test of Hand Function, and a Kinematic reach to grasp test. Results. Subjects as a group improved in fractionation of the fingers, thumb and finger range of motion, and thumb and finger speed, retaining those gains at the 1-week retention test. Transfer of these improvements was demonstrated through changes in the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and a decrease after the therapy in the overall time from hand peak velocity to the moment when an object was lifted from the table. Conclusions. It is difficult in current service delivery models to provide the intensity of practice that appears to be needed to effect neural reorganization and functional changes poststroke. Computerized exercise systems may be a way to maximize both the patients’ and the clinicians’ time.

In the Department of Veterans Affairs "Study to Optimize the DEKA Arm," we attempted to facilitate motor learning by using a virtual reality environment (VRE) program. This VRE program allows users to practice controlling an avatar using the controls designed to operate the DEKA Arm in the real world. In this article, we provide highlights from our experiences implementing VRE in training amputees to use the full DEKA Arm. This article discusses the use of VRE in amputee rehabilitation, describes the VRE system used with the DEKA Arm, describes VRE training, provides qualitative data from a case study of a subject, and provides recommendations for future research and implementation of VRE in amputee rehabilitation.

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Postural control associated with self-paced movement is critical for balance in frail older adults. The present work aimed to investigate the effects of a 2D virtual reality-based program on postural control associated with rapid arm movement in this population.
Methods
Participants in an upright standing position performed rapid arm-raising movements towards a target. Practice-related changes were assessed by pre- and post-test comparisons of hand kinematics and centre-of-pressure (CoP) displacement parameters measured in a training group and a control group. During these pre- and post-test sessions, patients have to reach towards yellow balls appearing on the screen, form a standardized upright position (with 15cm between the two malleoli). Training group patients took part in six sessions of virtual game. In this, patients were asked to reach their arm towards yellow balls appearing on the screen, from an upright position.
Results
After training, we observed improvements in arm movements and in the initial phase of CoP displacement, especially in the anticipatory postural adjustments. Learning curves for these two types of motor improvements showed different rates. These were continuous for the control of the arm movement, and discontinuous for the control of the CoP during the anticipatory postural adjustments.
Conclusion
These results suggest that some level of motor (re)-learning is maintained in frail patients with low functional reserves. They also suggest that re-learning of anticipatory postural control (i.e. motor prediction) is less robust than explicit motor learning involved for the arm reaching. This last point should encourage clinicians to extend the training course duration, even if reaching movement improvements seems acquired, in order to automate these anticipatory postural activities. However, other studies should be done to measure the retention of these two types of learning on a longer-term period.
Résumé
Introduction
Le contrôle postural associé à un déséquilibre auto-généré (intrinsèque) est essentiel dans la gestion de la fonction d’équilibration, notamment pour des patients âgés fragiles. Ce travail avait pour objectif d’étudier les effets d’un programme d’entraînement, basé sur un outil de réalité virtuelle en 2D, sur le contrôle postural associé à un mouvement rapide du membre supérieur au sein de cette population.
Méthodes
Les participants effectuaient des mouvements rapides du membre supérieur à partir de la position debout. Les changements liés à l’entraînement ont été évalués par des comparaisons pré- et post-test sur les paramètres cinématiques des déplacements de la main et du centre de pression (CdP), mesurés au sein d’un groupe témoin et d’un groupe entraîné. Pendant ces séances pré- et post-tests, les patients devaient pointer en direction de ballons jaunes qui apparaissaient sur l’écran, à partir d’une position debout standardisée (pieds placés avec 15cm d’écartement entre les deux malléoles). Les patients du groupe entraînement prenaient part à 6 séances d’entraînement par utilisation du jeu virtuel. Sur celui-ci, les patients devaient pointer en direction de ballons jaunes qui apparaissaient à l’écran, à partir de la position debout.
Résultats
Après l’entraînement, nous avons observé des améliorations du mouvement du membre supérieur et de la phase initiale du contrôle postural, notamment pendant la phase correspondant aux ajustements posturaux anticipés. Les courbes d’apprentissage, pour ces deux types d’optimisation motrice, étaient différentes. Celle observée pour le contrôle du mouvement du membre supérieur était continue pendant l’ensemble de l’entraînement, alors que celle observée pour le contrôle du centre de pression pendant les ajustements posturaux anticipés, révélatrice de l’optimisation de la prédiction motrice, était discontinue.
Conclusion
Ces résultats suggèrent qu’un certain niveau d’apprentissage (ou de réapprentissage) est maintenu chez des patients fragiles présentant de faibles ressources fonctionnelles. Ils suggèrent également que le réapprentissage du contrôle postural anticipé est moins robuste que l’apprentissage moteur explicite constaté pour le mouvement du membre supérieur. Ce dernier point devrait encourager les cliniciens à prolonger la durée de l’entraînement, même si des améliorations semblent acquises pour le mouvement du membre supérieur, afin d’automatiser les activités posturales anticipées. Néanmoins, d’autres études doivent être mises en place pour mesurer à plus long terme la rétention de ces différents apprentissages.},

	abstract = {Question: In people after stroke, does virtual reality based rehabilitation (VRBR) improve walking speed, balance and mobility more than the same duration of standard rehabilitation? In people after stroke, does adding extra VRBR to standard rehabilitation improve the effects on gait, balance and mobility? Design: Systematic review with meta-analysis of randomised trials. Participants: Adults with a clinical diagnosis of stroke. Intervention: Eligible trials had to include one these comparisons: VRBR replacing some or all of standard rehabilitation or VRBR used as extra rehabilitation time added to a standard rehabilitation regimen. Outcome measures: Walking speed, balance, mobility and adverse events. Results: In total, 15 trials involving 341 participants were included. When VRBR replaced some or all of the standard rehabilitation, there were statistically significant benefits in walking speed (MD 0.15 m/s, 95\% CI 0.10 to 0.19), balance (MD 2.1 points on the Berg Balance Scale, 95\% CI 1.8 to 2.5) and mobility (MD 2.3 seconds on the Timed Up and Go test, 95\% CI 1.2 to 3.4). When VRBR was added to standard rehabilitation, mobility showed a significant benefit (0.7 seconds on the Timed Up and Go test, 95\% CI 0.4 to 1.1), but insufficient evidence was found to comment about walking speed (one trial) and balance (high heterogeneity). Conclusion: Substituting some or all of a standard rehabilitation regimen with VRBR elicits greater benefits in walking speed, balance and mobility in people with stroke. Although the benefits are small, the extra cost of applying virtual reality to standard rehabilitation is also small, especially when spread over many patients in a clinic. Adding extra VRBR time to standard rehabilitation also has some benefits; further research is needed to determine if these benefits are clinically worthwhile.
