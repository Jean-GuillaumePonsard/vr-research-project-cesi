\section{Introduction}

This document is presenting the articles and the context leading to a problematic for our research project about Virtual Reality for human rehabilitation.


\section{Context}

Definition:
The Virtual Reality (VR) technology is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place in a simulated environment. 
\\
Nowadays, the VR technology is composed of a head mounted display and 3D audio headphones.
\\
This technology allows for a fully imersive experience for the user.

Evolution:
Virtual Reality has been commercially available since the late 80's, with the first systems sold by VPL Research.
This technology has always evolved through time thanks to better computer technology and better softwares.
\\
This contributed to the "rebirth" of the VR in the late 90's and later in the late 2010's.
